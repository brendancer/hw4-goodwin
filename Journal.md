As I approach this homework I am making a battle plan. After some psuedocoding, I plan to first cover the HTML, which I think will not be too difficult. Then CSS, where I'll make use of Bootsrap templates. Finally I'll move into the javascript. 

In order to do this I will have to do some review of html, css, and javascript-including a lot of hardcore learning of web APIs. In the revious weeks, I have watched beginning tutorials of each subject. This is effective for my learning and confidence, but has delayed the starting of my homework until Wednesday evening. This has proved to not be optimal.

I'm realy shakey on Web API, so I am starting today(Sunday) instead of taking a day off (I'll take half a day off!)
I'll find a tutorial of 1-2 hours and watch it all today, also review HTML and get started on it.

Tomorrow I hope to finish the html framework of the quiz.
