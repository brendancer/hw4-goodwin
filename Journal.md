Sunday

As I approach this homework I am making a battle plan. After some psuedocoding, I plan to first cover the HTML, which I think will not be too difficult. Then CSS, where I'll make use of Bootsrap templates. Finally I'll move into the javascript.

In order to do this I will have to do some review of html, css, and javascript-including a lot of hardcore learning of web APIs. In the revious weeks, I have watched beginning tutorials of each subject. This is effective for my learning and confidence, but has delayed the starting of my homework until Wednesday evening. This has proved to not be optimal.

I'm realy shakey on Web API, so I am starting today(Sunday) instead of taking a day off (I'll take half a day off!)
I'll find a tutorial of 1-2 hours and watch it all today, also review HTML and get started on it.

Tomorrow I hope to finish the html framework of the quiz.

Monday
Reviewed HTML, CSS, and javascript by watching tutorials. Studied web API and became a little more comfortable with it. Looked at my HTML for this project and heaved a heavy sigh. Went to bed.

Tuesday
Found a web tutorial about quiz making. It was fantastic. I watched it most of the way through, and now I have some more ideas of how to start. Make use of more arrays/objects. Should have thought of that on my own, but now I can get started. A little more clear of event listeners and buttons. I'll expolre what web/browser APIs I can use to make things easier.
